== FEATURED VIDEO CAROUSEL ==

The Sundance theme offers a featured video carousel on the home page. All you have to do to activate is create a sticky post with the video post format. Then add an excerpt, which appears to the right of the video, as you can see in the screenshot below. Once you have more than one featured video, the arrows and the indicator appear. You are able to feature a maximum of ten posts in the carousel.

== THEME OPTIONS ==

The Sundance theme lets you add social network links on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, and Flickr as well as RSS2 link in the sidebar so that your readers are able to stay connected through these.

== RESPONSIVE DESIGN ==

The Sundance theme is designed with responsive design in mind. It provides a tailored layout depending on the device you are using. This makes your blog look good not only on desktop browsers, but also on devices with smaller screens, such as the iPad and iPhone.

== WIDGET AREA ==

The Sundance theme offers an optional sidebar with widgets. If you choose to add widgets to the sidebar in Widgets setting under Appearance, they will be displayed in a right-hand sidebar. If you prefer a single-column design, you may leave the sidebar empty as well as disable the social network links and then the main column will span the entire width of the layout.

== CUSTOM APPEARANCE ==
Customize Sundance theme even more with the custom background feature, a custom header image, a custom menu, and a full-width template.
