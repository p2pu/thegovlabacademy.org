== ABOUT DUSTER ==

Duster is an Automattic-produced theme designed and developed by the Theme Team which, apart from the custom possibilities youâ€™re acquainted with in most of our themes -- features like custom backgrounds, headers, and menus -- is also equipped with a custom Showcase Page Template that can propel your site up to a new level.

With the help of the Showcase Template you can make your front page display an introductory text message, a featured post with an image -- big or small, your call -- at the top, a recent post column showing the full latest post and a list of other recent posts below, and a sidebar with a custom widget that displays your Aside or Link posts.

You can read more about Duster and how to setup the Showcase Template here:
